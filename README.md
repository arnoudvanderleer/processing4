Processing 4 makes important updates to the code to prepare the platform for its future. Most significantly, this includes the move to Java 17 and support for new Java language features. The changes should be transparent to most users, but because of the massive shift behind the scenes, this is 4.0. We have also moved to a new repository for this release so that we could cull a lot of the accumulated mess of the last 20 years, which makes git clone (and most other git operations) a lot faster. Check the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for more.

# [Processing4.0](https://processing.org/)

Welcome! üëãüëãüèøüëãüèΩüëãüèªüëãüèæüëãüèº

This is the official source code for the [Processing](http://processing.org) Development Environment (PDE), the Java "core" and the Java libraries that are included with the [download](http://processing.org/download).

Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. It is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. There are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning and prototyping.

The [processing](https://processing.org/) website contains an extensive overview of the project and community. It also contains documentation, tutorials, and examples. The [processing overview](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/) wiki page is also a good place to start.
For more information about the historical development and old bugs and issues, you can check [the old repository](https://github.com/processing/processing/) of processing.

## Community

Processing is a community effort led by a small group of volunteers. See the [processing foundation](https://discourse.processing.org/) to get started! If you want to contribute to the project, check out the [contributor docs](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more in-depth details about different areas of the project, including code, bug fixes, documentation, discussion, and more.

## Get Started

The Processing Development Environment (PDE) makes it easy to write Processing programs. Programs are written in the Text Editor and started by pressing the Run button. In Processing, a computer program is called a sketch. Sketches are stored in the Sketchbook, which is a folder on your computer.

You can create 2D and 3D art with Processing sketches. With library and tool extensions, installed via the "contribution manager", you can do even more! For example, playing sounds, doing computer vision, and working with advanced 3D geometry.

Learn more about sketching with processing on the [Tutorial](https://processing.org/tutorials) page and find an extensive overview of everything you can do in the [Reference](https://processing.org/reference). A list of the [Libraries](https://processing.org/reference/libraries) and [Tools](https://processing.org/reference/tools) are also available on our website.

Check out [processing.org](https://processing.org/) for lots more! Here are some quick-links to get started learning processing.

## Issues

### I've found a bug!
Let us know [here](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues) (after first checking if someone has already posted a similar problem).<br />
If it is a reference, web site, or examples issue, take that up with folks [here](https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues). <br />
There are also separate locations for
 * [JavaScript Mode](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues);
 * [Android Mode](https://github.com/processing/processing-android/issues);
 * [Python Mode](https://github.com/jdf/processing.py/issues);
 * The [Video](https://github.com/processing/processing-video/issues) library;
 * The [Sound](https://github.com/processing/processing-sound/issues) library.

### Locked Issues
Where possible, issues will be locked once resolved. This helps reduce the amount of noise from folks adding to an issue that has been closed for years. Because this project has existed for a long time, the [old repository](https://github.com/processing/processing/) had thousands of closed issues. Lots of them may sound similar to an issue you are having, but if there is a new problem, it will be missed if you mention it in a comment added to an already closed issue. Locking issues is not ideal, because it cuts off conversation, but it is better than legitimate problems being missed. Once an issue has been resolved for 30 days, it will automatically lock.

### And finally...
Someday we will also fix all these bugs, throw together hundreds of unit tests, and get rich off all this stuff that we are giving away for free. But not today.

So in the meantime, we ask for your patience, [participation](CONTRIBUTING.md), and [patches](https://github.com/processing/processing4/pulls).
