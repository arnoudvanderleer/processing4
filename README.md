Processing 4 makes important updates to the code to prepare the platform for its future. Most significantly, this includes the move to Java 17 and support for new Java language features. The changes should be transparent to most users, but because of the massive shift behind the scenes, this is 4.0. We've also moved to a new repository for this release so that we could cull a lot of the accumulated mess of the last 20 years, which makes git clone (and most other git operations) a lot faster. Check the [changelog](https://github.com/arnoudvanderleer/processing4/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more.

# [Processing4.0](https://processing.org/)

Welcome! üëãüëãüèøüëãüèΩüëãüèªüëãüèæüëãüèº

This is the official source code for the [Processing](http://processing.org) Development Environment (PDE), the "core" and the libraries that are included with the [download](http://processing.org/download). You can also check [the old repository](https://github.com/processing/processing/) of processing.

Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. It is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. There are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning and prototyping.

The [processing](https://processing.org/) website contains an extensive overview of the project, community, documentation, tutorial, and examples, the [processing overview](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Exorcising-AWT) wiki page is also a good place to start.

## Community

Processing is a community effort led by a small group of volunteers.. See the [processing foundation](https://discourse.processing.org/) to get started! If you want to contribute to the project, check out the [contributor docs](https://p5js.org/contributor-docs/#/) for more in-depth details about different areas of the project, including code, bug fixes, documentation, discussion, and more.

## Get Started

The Processing Development Environment (PDE) makes it easy to write Processing programs. Programs are written in the Text Editor and started by pressing the Run button. In Processing, a computer program is called a sketch. Sketches are stored in the Sketchbook, which is a folder on your computer.

You can create 2D and 3D art with processing on your sketches. With library and tools extensions, you can create new things like playing sounds, doing computer vision, and working with advanced 3D geometry. 

Learn more about sketching with processing on the [Tutorial](https://processing.org/tutorials) and find everything you can do in the [Reference](https://processing.org/reference). The [Libraries](https://processing.org/reference/libraries) and [Tools](https://processing.org/reference/tools) are also available on our website.

Check out [processing](https://processing.org/) for lots more! Here are some quick-links to get started learning processing.

## Issues

**I've found a bug!**<br />Let us know [here](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues) (after first checking if someone has already posted a similar problem).<br />If it's a reference, web site, or examples issue, take that up with folks [here](https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues).<br />There are also separate locations for [Android Mode](https://github.com/processing/processing-android/issues), or the [Video](https://github.com/processing/processing-video/issues) and [Sound](https://github.com/processing/processing-sound/issues) libraries.<br />The [processing.js](http://processingjs.org) project is not affiliated with us, but you can find their issue tracker [here](https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js/issues).

**Locked Issues**<br />Where possible, I've started locking issues once resolved. This helps reduce the amount of noise from folks adding to an issue that's been closed for years. Because this project has existed for a long time and we have thousands of closed issues, lots of them may sound similar to an issue you're having. But if there's a new problem, it'll be missed if it's lost in a comment added to an already closed issue. I don't like to lock issues because it cuts off conversation, but it's better than legitimate problems being missed. Once an issue has been resolved for 30 days, it will automatically lock.

**That **[**processing-bugs**](https://github.com/processing-bugs)** fella is suspicious.**<br />The issues list has been imported from Google Code, so there are many spurious references<br />amongst them since the numbering changed. Basically, any time you see references to<br />changes made by [processing-bugs](https://github.com/processing-bugs), it may be somewhat suspect.<br />Over time this will clean itself up as bugs are fixed and new issues are added from within GitHub.<br />Help speed this process along by helping us!

**Please help.**<br />The instructions for building the source [are here](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Build-Instructions).<br />Please help us fix problems, and if you're submitting code, following the [style guidelines](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Style-Guidelines) helps save me a lot of time.

**And finally...**<br />Someday we'll also fix all these bugs, throw together hundreds of unit tests, and get rich off all this stuff that we're giving away for free. But not today.

So in the meantime, I ask for your patience,<br />[participation](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List), and [patches](https://github.com/processing/processing/pulls).
